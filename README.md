# My Programming Journey
Back in 2019, I embarked on a journey to learn programming. My approach was simple: make as many projects as possible to gain experience. I watched countless tutorials and created recommended projects. As I progressed, I began to branch out and create programs based on my own ideas. They weren't necessarily groundbreaking, but they were projects I was passionate about and enjoyed building.

Looking back, I realize that those early days built the foundation for the programmer I am today. Although it might not seem like much, I'm proud of the effort I put in and the progress I've made. Most importantly, I had a ton of fun along the way!
